# Pseuco

Students on the IGCSE and IB Computer Science qualifications need to
demonstrate that they can write pseudo-code to the exam-board
specifications.

Pseuco is a compiler for these pseudo-code languages.
It is written in [Google Dart](http://www.dartlang.org) and compiles to
Javascript, allowing it to be embedded in web-pages and run purely
on the client side.
